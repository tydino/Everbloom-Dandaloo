I am adding this now as it is public.

this is meant for clarity purposes and so you all can see what i am adding in real time.

do note that some things in here are bound to change before their respective video and for no reason can you compile it and release it as your own. (copyright is fun) Do also note that I do plan on adding far more then what is here currently. I will go into detail on everything in here as voted in my youtube's community tab up until the finale, which wont happen for a long time.


what i need help with:
getting access to the techreborn items.
ideas for what to add. (pratically a community project of sorts, you can offer ideas in one of my video comment sections and if it is appropriate it may be added!)

overviews of what is being added to minecraft through my mod: (currently in/soon to be added)

1. the aether:

primarily the definition of it as a place. Particularly the subspace far above the earth where it was beleived by greece to be a ethereal place where everything is close yet still different to earth.

2. dinosaurs and a way to go back in time:

With this is where techreborn is being used as a base, for making it to the dimension where you can even get the thing to tame the dinosaurs you will need some things from that, and adding to it to allow for also getting dinosaurs very soon after actually going to the past. (the past will have some things you need for the machines to get the tamable versions of the dinosaurs)

3. cooking/baking/more food:

as can be seen if you dig through these files; there is pizza and tomatoes. For those who want all the fruit/cooking materials you will need to do dimension hopping to get everything!

4. more advancements/acheivements:

pretty self explainable, a simple reward for completing some sort of challenge or especially for where i plan for this to have a smp at some point, to allow all to know what you have accomplished if at least someone is online!

5. as stated before (in cooking) i am adding several dimensions

not much to put here, but do know that it will be hard to complete!
